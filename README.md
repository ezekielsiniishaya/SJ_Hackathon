# - A Social Platform for Posting and Interactions

# Overview

This web application is a simple yet interactive social platform that allows users to register, log in, post content, comment on posts, and interact with other users. It's designed with features that encourage user engagement and provide a seamless experience for managing user-generated content.

# Current Features

User Authentication:

Secure user registration and login functionality.
Passwords are hashed with bcrypt for security, and JWT tokens are used for user authentication.
User Posts:

Authenticated users can create posts and share them on the platform.
Posts contain the author's details, content, and a timestamp.
Comments:

Users can comment on posts, with each comment linked to a specific post and the commenting user.
User Logout:

Users can securely log out, and their JWT tokens are invalidated to prevent unauthorized access after logout.

# Planned Features

Liking Posts: Users can like posts, and the platform will display posts based on popularity in user feeds.
User Feeds: Once users log in, they will see a personalized feed showing posts sorted by the number of likes or posts from people they follow.
User Profiles: Profile pages will show user details, their posts, and posts theyâ€™ve liked, with an option to update their profile.
Follow System: Users can follow others, with their feed showing posts from people they follow.
Threaded Comments: Comments will support replies to create discussions around posts.
Search Functionality: Users will be able to search for posts based on keywords, hashtags, or specific users.
Notifications: Real-time notifications will alert users when someone likes or comments on their posts.
Hashtags: Posts can include hashtags, and users can filter posts by these tags.
Direct Messaging: A simple chat feature to allow private messages between users.
Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js with Express.js, MongoDB for database storage, and JWT for user authentication.
Frontend: Can be integrated with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or frameworks like React.
Security: Uses bcrypt for password hashing, JWT tokens for secure user sessions, and a blacklist system for token invalidation upon logout.
Future Improvements
We plan to add more features to enhance user engagement and interactivity, such as post liking, search functionality, profile updates, and more.
